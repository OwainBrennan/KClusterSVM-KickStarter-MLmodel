This project focuses on exploring the success rates of creative projects and the factors that lead to success using data sourced
from the creative project crowdfunding site “Kickstarter” (Kickstarter, 2009) with the data set sources from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects.
Throughout the report a data set is collected,The data set is then explored, cleaned, prepared and finally two machine learning models are developed.
One model based on categorizing projects included in the data set and another to identify aspects that lead to a creative project being a success using the
K means clustering and SVM models respectively.
These models are then tuned and optimized for higher accuracy and better implementation.

By completing the project and implementing the models it was found there are three distinct groups in the data set that businesses can be categorized in
based on their numeric values. It was also found that there are clear influences that lead to project success because of the high accuracy model developed.
The models developed can also be used by project founders to see how their projects would be categorized and whether based on past projects it was be a success.

This project was developed as a part of a report.
